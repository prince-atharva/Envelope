## [Unreleased]

### Added

- pnpm workspace monorepo: `apps/*` and `packages/*`, Node 22, TypeScript 6 in strict mode.
- Biome 2 for linting and formatting (no ESLint or Prettier). NestJS parameter decorators are
  enabled, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is an error, and `console.log` is not allowed.
- `@digitalsign/shared` package: brand constants, upload and password limits, and the full error
  catalog (codes and HTTP statuses) from docs/08 plus the upload-hardening errors.
